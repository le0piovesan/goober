## Technical Overview

### Frontend

- **Database:** [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)
- **ORM:** [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/)

## Product Decisions

- **Ride Request Process:**

  - Riders can request a taxi ride, specifying pickup and dropoff locations.
  - Goober automatically dispatches available drivers, providing a quote based on trip distance and other factors.
  - Riders do not need to select a driver; the system handles the assignment.
  - Riders can cancel ongoing rides.

- **Driver Interaction:**
  - Drivers can receive ride requests and choose to accept or decline.
  - Each ride comes with an indication of the payment amount.
  - Once a ride is accepted, drivers won't receive new requests until the ride is complete.
  - Drivers receive relevant information for pickup and completion of the ride.
  - Drivers can cancel ongoing rides.

## UX Decisions

- **User Flow:**

  - Streamlined user flows for both riders and drivers.
  - Intuitive interfaces for requesting rides and managing ongoing rides.
  - Clear communication of ride details, including pickup and dropoff locations.
  - Minimal user interactions to ensure a smooth experience.

- **Real-time Updates:**
  - Leverage Supabase for real-time updates on ride requests and status changes.
  - Provide notifications to both riders and drivers for important events (e.g., ride acceptance, cancellation).

## Risk and Unknowns

- **Risk:** Handling real-time updates and notifications efficiently.

  - **Resolution Plan:** Implement and test Supabase integration thoroughly. Explore strategies for optimizing real-time communication.

- **Unknown:** Scalability challenges as the user base grows.
  - **Resolution Plan:** Regularly assess application performance and scalability. Implement optimizations based on usage patterns.

## Final Considerations

Oh, what a ride. I am always grateful for having the chance to learn new technologies, such as Supabase and T3, while simultaneously striving for this great opportunity.
While I had previous experience with Firebase, it offered a solid foundation but also presented its own set of challenges on the way. Having to attend work, taking care of some development and deploys at the same time, made it a little bit harder this challenge.
There are still room for improvement, but overall I am really glad of what I could made within a week!

The feature I found to be the most impressive was the responsiveness of the UX/UI layout in the WepApp. I consistently strive to prioritize accessibility in my development process.
